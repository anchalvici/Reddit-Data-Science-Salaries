DS is such a multi facet role that no one degree fits what you need, you always going have to fill the gaps ( for you I guess it's learning python /software engineering sphere, for them it's business knowledge etc) , so yes I do believe Economics is a great start. I have spent years sharpen up my software engineering skills /learning  deep learning models / relearning linear Algebra (honestly went over my head at uni).

            "\n",
            "But to say a little bit more - if you want to get paid a lot of money, you have to be able to deliver high value projects. The projects I work on measure their impact in the billions of dollars. When you operate at this scale, there are just a lot of things to know.\n",
            "\n",
            "One way to think about it is that at least 2 people on the team need to understand any technology/methodology that we want to use, or we can't appropriately review that work. And if you have overall responsibility for the project, you should understand it well enough to defend the decision to use it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another way to think about it is that the team is doing a lot of different types of work and all of that work has to be effective. It can basically never happen that the team was blocked for any serious amount of time because somebody didn't understand the tech well enough. Even if there are other so-called experts on it in the company, they're never going to care about your work as much as you do, and it's always going to go a lot faster if you can debug deeply yourself.\n",
            "Sure.  MBA is a mindset.  Many PMs are trained in that mindset too.  I also went to a MBA program that feeds a lot of people to McKinsey, BCG, etc, and tech is full of those types as well, so being able to communicate with them this is very valuable.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'd say the two most important classes were corporate strategy and negotiations.  That said, the network was insanely valuable too.\n",
            "I didn’t choose those subjects and did generic applied micro stuff plus some theory. Nor did I intend on tech specifically while writing my dissertation. A PhD is not necessary for every economist or data scientist role in tech but a must have for some specialised roles (Microsoft Research, Amazon, etc)\n",
            "Happy to help out! Feel free to reach out if you have questions about the job search or want a quick resume review. I’m also happy to connect on something like LinkedIn if you’re looking to network a bit.\n",
            "I haven't done a full interview loop in nearly a decade (and nerves definitely got the better of me in a lot of my early-career interviews), so am probably not the best person to ask for advice on that.\n",
            "\n",
            "I will say that as someone on the other side of the room in those, training materials have gotten far better, and it seems pretty straightforward to look up/research what an interview at a given large company will look like in a way that wasn't possible a decade or so ago.\n",
            "Yes. IMO all that type of work boils down to: if you make these unfalsifiable conditional independence assumptions, you can make these causal inferences. But when you have messy data, those assumptions are always suspect. Causal discovery is nonsense and fancy data summary. It’s mathematicallly impossible to discover causal effects. Even mediation analysis , which was all the rage, produces extremely unreliable estimates and a lot of that work doesn’t replicate. If you’re in a domain with more deterministic relationships between variables, that type of causal inference work is probably more useful that what I’ve been working on.\n",
            "Thank you very much\n",
            "Can I do what you do without a PhD in stats, but maybe an MBA with my MS stats?\n",
            "At my last job my supervisor's mid-level manager was an MBA but no degree in data science or statistics. He was nice enough but still rubbed me the wrong way - a little condescending to me despite his lack of experience and ingratiating to the director of the department. I kept thinking what is this guy doing here?\n",
            "Yep, I myself have a master’s in econ. When I finished it, I was on the fence in regards to how to continue. Eventually I decided to pursue another master’s, in stats, and to transition into tech. Before that I had some experience in research, but in econ it takes a phd to gain access to the good jobs.\n",
            "Is your work now essentially applied micro?\n",
            "I have a master's degree in econ. How do I break into an economist or data scientist role in tech? I did get into a T10 PhD program but decided against it and am now unsure of what I can do with my degree\n",
            "Thank you so much..! I really appreciate that. I would love to connect just to learn. I would DM you about connecting on LinkedIn and the other stuff.\n",
            "Applied Micro is a large part of it- evaluating pilots, complex experiments, etc. But closer to applied econometrics in that we try new estimators to solve business problems and evaluate efficacy via simulations. Also a lot of writing internal research papers, more broad data science stuff (think ML, SHAP values, occasionally survival curves, customer satisfaction, causal discovery, collaborating with NLP specialists, etc), and the usual business stakeholder management\n",
            "Do you develop new estimators? I’m a political scientist by training so very close to applied micro but far from theoretical econometrics\n",
            "I personally haven’t and you don’t need to develop new estimators to succeed in the role, but some people do develop new estimators and if proven to add value get rewarded. Staying current on the literature is valued though, and if you can apply novel techniques to solve outstanding business problems you’ll do well\n",
            "If he is at Amazon, they have particular pipelines explicitly for economist and a causal inference track is one of htem. I've seen applied scientist roles though at other companies that look at a mor broad group of social scientist (meta)\n",
            "Ha everyone I know from my PhD program at Mets in those social science roles got laid off!\n"

I am in MADS by UMich, which is not the most rigorous or prestigious, but it fits my goals, budget, and schedule. There are people who go through it and think that that is all they need to get a job.

My husband is a Software Engineer whose first job was 55k, very low, and now after 4 years is about at his salary cap. Get your foot in the door then job hop up to a better salary if that's what it takes. Because I wasn't expecting to have gotten my job and of my husband's career, the comfiness of my position is more important than the pay. That's a privilege, I know. My husband job hopped from each position at 1 year, almost 1 year, 3 months, and has been at his dream company 2 years.

After his BS he didn't have coding skills outside of R which I think hurt him. More recently I think the market has been terrible. I've been looking around in case HR tries to fuck with my remote status and a lot of places will require 2 years minimum while most positions available are senior which require 5.
